# nRulesExperiment

C# project for experimenting with [nRules](https://github.com/NRules/NRules).

The rules were built up incrementally to cover work-related rules related to calculating amounts that are based on rules about the various dimensions associated with 
funding plans for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
